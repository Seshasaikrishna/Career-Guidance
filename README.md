# To-Do List Application

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a simple web-based to-do list application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. This project will help students practice front-end web development skills and gain experience in building interactive web applications.

## Project Description
This project is a to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application provides a user-friendly interface and is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Requirements
### User Interface:
- A visually appealing user interface for the to-do list using HTML and CSS.
- An input section where users can input a new task.
- Display the list of tasks with checkboxes to mark them as completed.
- Options to edit and delete tasks.

### Functionality:
- Users can add new tasks by entering text and pressing the "Add" button.
- Each task has an option to mark it as completed or incomplete by checking/unchecking a checkbox.
- Option to edit the task description.
- Option to delete tasks they no longer need.

### Validation:
- Basic validation to ensure that users cannot add empty tasks.
- Handle any potential errors gracefully and provide clear feedback to users.

### Local Storage:
- Use Firebase Firestore to store the to-do list data so that tasks persist even if the user refreshes the page.

### Responsive Design:
- Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Use CSS media queries for responsiveness.

## Additional Features (Optional):
- Task prioritization
- Due dates
- Task categories
